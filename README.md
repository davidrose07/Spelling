I created this application to help my daughter with her spelling tests. This application takes a list of words and scrambles each word. This is created with QT with Ubuntu OS.

How it works:   The first window to appear gives a list of weeks that you can add words to. you save the words and then select use the words. It will then check each word to make sure it is in the English dictionary. 
                If so it creates a mp3 file and saves the list in a database. The word is then scrambled and displayed as follows:

Buttons:    Speak button gives an option to play the mp3 and speak the word to give a hint.
            Validate button checks to see if the word is right or wrong. If wrong the display to the right will show where the letters are out of place.  (Right answer plays thats right)  (Wrong answer plays thats wrong)
